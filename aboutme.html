			Bio: I am a 16 year old homeschooling highschool incoming junior.
			<br>I am taking community college classes at Foothill, Mission, and San Jose City college.
			<br>I enjoy computer programming, running, graphic designing, reading, biking, and drawing.
			<br>Classes I have taken so far at community colleges include:
			<br>Intermediate Algebra, Reading and Composition, Astronomy, Graphic Design, Elementary Statistics, Drawing, Java Programming, US History, and Marketing
			<br>The picture on the left is a color pencil cat I drew.
			<br>I have two sisters (15 and 12) and one brother (4).
			<br>My sister and I are 10.5 months apart, so we share the same age for 1.5 months.
			<br>My brother and I are 12 years apart. So when he will be 8, I will be 20!! WEIRD!!
			<br><br>FUN FACTS!!!
			<br>I have been coding since I was nine. My dad and I are the only ones who code. My sisters hate it and think it is boring.
			<br>I created an app called Math-a-morphosis for all app three stores!
			<br>I can solve a rubik's cube in under two minutes!
			<br>I love ICE CUBES!!!
			<br>My favorite food is lasagna
			<br>I was homeschooled since the beginning, so I still don't know what going to school is like.
			<br>This page includes 4 of my favorite colors! Guess them all!!!
			<br>I am a grammar and writing police. I can point out grammar mistakes in anything! So my dad calls me to check his grammar whenever he is writing a formal email.
			<br>Once I created a Google slides, 12 pages long, filled with the images of all the jokes I like. It contains over 220 jokes!!!

							<br>3. "Did your parents homeschool you because you are a muslim <strong>girl</strong>?"
							ðŸ˜“ NO!!!! My little brother will be homeschooled. I am homeschooled because I was very ahead when I was smalll.
							When I was going to go to Pre-k, my dad and mom visited a school. He saw teachers not teaching kids, but more wasting their time, so he was like, "No way!"</li>

			My favorite webpages are Google Drive, Outlook, and Google Images.
			<br>Google images is my favorite because I get to look at jokes, memes, cute baby animals, gifs, and anything else that makes me happy.
			<br>On the right is a game I created on scratch.
