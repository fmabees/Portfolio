			Bio: I am a 16 year old homeschooling highschool incoming junior.
			<br>I enjoy computer programming, running, graphic designing, reading, biking, and drawing.
			<br>I am taking community college classes at Foothill, Mission, and San Jose City college.
			<br>Classes I have taken so far at community colleges include:
			<br>Intermediate Algebra, Reading and Composition, Astronomy, Graphic Design, Elementary Statistics, Drawing, Java Programming, US History, and Marketing
			<br>The picture on the left is a color pencil cat I drew.
			<br>I have two sisters (15 and 12) and one brother (4).
			<br>My sister and I are 10.5 months apart, so we share the same age for 1.5 months.
			<br>My brother and I are 12 years apart. So when he will be 8, I will be 20!! WEIRD!!

			FUN FACTS!!!
			<br>I have been coding since I was nine. My dad and I are the only ones who code. My sisters hate it and think it is boring.
			<br>Computer languages I know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, XAML, Java, AXML, Python, and XML
			<br>I created an app called Math-a-morphosis for all three app stores!
			<br>I can solve a rubik's cube in under two minutes!
			<br>I love ICE CUBES!!!
			<br>I know three languages (English, Urdu, Hindi) and am almost done learning my fourth (Arabic).
			<br>My favorite food is lasagna.
			<br>I was homeschooled since the beginning, so I still don't know what going to school is like.
			<br>I am a grammar and writing police. I can point out grammar mistakes in anything! So my dad calls me to check his grammar whenever he is writing a formal email.
			<br>Once, I created a Google slides, 12 pages long, filled with the images of all the jokes I like. It contains over 220 jokes!!!
